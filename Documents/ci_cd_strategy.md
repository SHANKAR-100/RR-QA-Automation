CI/CD Strategy for Automation Execution

**Objective:**
Ensure continuous validation of TMDB demo web application features by integrating automated tests with CI/CD pipelines.

**Pipeline Overview:**

Stage					Description																Tool
1. Code Checkout		Clone the GitHub repository and set up the working directory			GitHub Actions / Jenkins
2. Environment Setup	Create virtual environment, install dependencies from requirements.txt	Python, pip
3. Lint & Syntax Check	Validate .robot and .py files for syntax errors							robocop, flake8
4. Test Execution		Run all Robot Framework suites (robot TestSuites/)						Robot Framework
5. Report Generation	Generate report.html, log.html, and output.xml							Built-in Robot Reporting
6. Artifact Publishing	Archive test reports for download or publish them as GitHub Pages		GitHub Actions / Jenkins Artifacts

**Execution Triggers:**

On Every Commit: Automatically run smoke tests.
Nightly Schedule: Execute full regression suite.
On Pull Requests: Validate only modified test suites.

**Outcome:**

Consistent test execution
Automatic reporting
Early defect detection
Scalable test runs for UI & API validations
